# KH2FM-Rando-Battleship
Battleship Board Generator for KH2FM Rando

Welcome to KH2FM Rando Battleship! Here are the instructions to get started.
                        
# Blind Mode (Pick ships BEFORE seeing board.)
1. Put your board into place mode by going to "Board Mode" -> "Place Mode (Blind)".
2. Place your ships. Confirm with your opponent what the ship sizes will be (standard is 5,4,3,3,2). Placed ships will show up in blue.
3. Once you have placed your ships, go to "Actions" -> "Download Ship Layout". This will create a file called "ships.zip."
4. Send the ships.zip file to your partner. This is how your partner will know whether they hit or miss your ships mid-run.
5. Make any customizations you want to make in the bottom few options of the Actions menu.
6. If you are the card generator, go to "Actions" -> "Download Board Settings". Then, go to "Actions" -> "Upload Board Settings" do get your customized board.  Send the settings.txt file in your battleship_rando folder over to all other opponents.
   If you are the seed receiver, go to "Actions" -> "Upload Board Settings" and select the txt you received from your opponent.
7. To get your opponent's ship data tracked, go to "Actions" -> "Upload Ship Layout" and select the "ships.zip" file you just received.
8. If you want autotracking, go to "Actions" -> "Start Autotracking". Note that it is recommended you wait until the game is loaded in before doing this.
