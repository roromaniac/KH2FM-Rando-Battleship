# KH2FM-Rando-Battleship
Battleship Board Generator for KH2FM Rando

Welcome to KH2FM Rando Battleship! Here are the instructions to get started.
                        
# Blind Mode (Pick ships BEFORE seeing board.)
1. Put your board into place mode by going to "Board Mode" -> "Place Mode (Blind)".
2. Place your ships. Confirm with your opponent what the ship sizes will be (standard is 5,4,3,3,2). Placed ships will show up in blue.
3. Once you have placed your ships, go to "Actions" -> "Download Ship Layout". This will create a file called "ships.zip."
4. Send the ships.zip file to your partner. This is how your partner will know whether they hit or miss your ships mid-run.
5. When you receive the ships.zip file, move it into the same folder you have the rando_battleship.exe. This replaces your old
   ships.zip and this is expected.
6. If you are the card generator, go to "Actions" -> "Generate New Card".  
   If you are the seed receiver, go to "Actions" -> "Load Card from Seed" and paste the seed you received from your opponent.
7. If you generated the seed, send the seed string to your opponent by either clicking "Info" -> "Seed" or "Actions" -> "Copy Seed Name".
   Either will copy the name of the string to your clipboard and you can send it to your opponent via Discord.
8. If you received the seed name, go to "Actions" -> "Load Card from Seed" and paste the seed name into the window.
9. To get your opponent's ship data tracked, go to "Actions" -> "Upload Ship Layout" and select the "ships.zip" file you just received.
10. If you did all of the above steps successfully, your ships that were marked blue have disappeared and the board is all black. You're ready to play!
    The button will turn gray if the check is a miss and red if the check is a hit.

# Visible Mode (Pick ships AFTER seeing board.)
1. If you are the card generator, go to "Actions" -> "Generate New Card". 
   If you are the seed receiver, go to "Actions" -> "Load Card from Seed" and paste the seed you received from your opponent.

   Either will copy the name of the string to your clipboard and you can send it to your opponent via Discord.
3. If you received the seed name, go to "Actions" -> "Load Card from Seed" and paste the seed name into the window.
4. Put your board into place mode by going to the "Board Mode" -> "Place Mode (Visible)".
5. Place your ships. Confirm with your opponent what the ship sizes will be (standard is 5,4,3,3,2). Placed ships will show up in blue.
6. Once you have placed your ships, go to "Actions" -> "Download Ship Layout". This will create a file called "ships.zip."

# Single Board Mode
1. Generate a new card and send the seedname to anyone who wants to partake.
2. ALL players should select "Board Mode" -> "Same Board Mode". Now all players have the same battleships hidden but loaded.
